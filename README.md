# HW_assigment_0a

You first homework assigment is to go through [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) tutorial from [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/).

You will be working on your local machine. [Download](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html) the required material and follow the detailed instructions. Please complete all sessions before the next class. It is a long tutorial but it is necessary to build a good foundation of Unix at the beginning of the course.

By the end of tutorial, you should have a basic knowledge of:
- moving around your computer using your terminal
- how to specify the location of a file or directory on my computer (using absolute and relative path)
- the most commonly used shell commands (and use options and arguments to change the behaviour of them)
- how to seek for help (besides Google)
- Construct command pipelines with two or more stages
- write simple loops
- write a shell script
- find things (files/folders or things in files)

We will go over snippets of this material next Tuesday but if you have major issues, please contact me.
